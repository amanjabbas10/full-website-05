  This is a car that reaches almost-supersonic speeds in less than 10 seconds. No matter what the drive mode or the weather, the E63 absolutely devours the horizon ahead. Eating clouds and air with the ferocity of a Veyron, the E63 AMG's accessible performance is part of its charm. A ride so smooth and brakes so strong, they make the Stingray and GT-R seem a bit under-prepared? Yep, that's the E63 AMG.

  Unlike hardcore sports cars or manual-transmission cars, getting totally relaxed and confident in the E63 is much quicker than with a Corvette Stingray or 370Z Nismo.
  
  This is a car that is so cool even blind people like it, and so easy to drive - that same blind man would be at home doing 100 mph plus in just a few minutes as well.
